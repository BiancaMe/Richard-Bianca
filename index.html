            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
           </p>
           <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
           </p>
           <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p> Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. </p>
              </li>
           </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="javascript" class="main-section">
          <header>
            <h1>JavaScript</h1>
          </header>

            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.

            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
